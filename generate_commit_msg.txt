1. First, get the number of files changed in the current working directory using git status --porcelain and count the modified/deleted files.

2. For each changed file, use git diff <filename> to read the changes, then provide a concise summary of what was modified.

3. Finally, create a commit message with emojis for sections and unicode bullet points (â€¢) for sub-items, summarizing the overall changes.

4. If any major new feature is added create a seperete section describing the features and enhancements.
